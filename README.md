# To Do List

This project proved to be more challenging. I struggled to understand how to get items into but more so, out of local storage. I kept writing loops that would create an infinite loop in the local storage API and crash my browser. There were a lot of long nights figuring out how to solve this problem.

This project taught me:
- ES6 Modules
- Configuring Webpack
- Local Storage API
- Patience & Persistence
